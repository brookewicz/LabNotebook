Started Sep 2023

## Table of Contents
### Protocols
- Contains: Dna extractions, microbiome enrichments, qubit
  
### 09-23-CBC_Enrichments
- enrichments done on CBC samples for 10/23 sequencing
- more info on - https://github.com/sagw/SCTLD_samples/blob/main/Sample_Data/Metagenomics_Tracker_Belize.csv

  
### 2019_2022_resequencing
- dna extractions, enrichments, and DNA concentrations on all 2019 and 2022 samples covering species MCAV, PSTR, OFAV, and OANN (some will be resequenced, some will be sequenced for the first time). more info on the inventory notebook and resequence_combined spreadsheet

#### Scripts 
- Extraction_Locat_Update: updates cbc_samples with extraction locations from metagenomics tracker
- resequence_plan: Determine number of samples to extract and enrich (2019 and 2022 only)
- SummaryStats: summarize number of samples for each species and categorize by year and health status
- Merge_reseq_meta: add final info from Resequence_combined.csv to metagenomics tracker
