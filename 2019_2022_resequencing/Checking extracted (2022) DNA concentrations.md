## remeasuring dna concentrations of previously extracted (2022) samples. 
- some have already been enriched, but just using extracted dna since the enriched labelling system is very hard to decipher
- trying to decide - but i think if the concentration is lower now than before and has been degraded, i will not use. if extracting from depleted doesn't go well, i will use. 
- Branae is measuring with qubit

To dos:
- using 48, 40, 49, and 51 extracted dna for enrichments 
- going to try to extract from depleted 50 and 12, and if that doesn't work, will use this extracted dna
