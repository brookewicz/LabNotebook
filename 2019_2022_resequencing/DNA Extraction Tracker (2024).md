##### Protocol Notes: 
###### 7-3-24
- for weighing, kept tissue samples on ice while not using, but did not keep on ice while actively pulling tissue out. handled open tubes around the flame. tried to cut pieces in tissue tube but used weigh paper underneath to catch anything. How should we be doing this? how can we standardize this better? 
- Put T4_13 chunk back in tissue sample tube after momentarily placing in disruptor tube because it was massive ): 
- used qubit to measure dna concentrations. 2 uL sample in 198 uL working solution.
