##### Protocol Notes: 
###### 7-3-24
- for weighing, kept tissue samples on ice while not using, but did not keep on ice while actively pulling tissue out. handled open tubes around the flame. tried to cut pieces in tissue tube but used weigh paper underneath to catch anything. How should we be doing this? how can we standardize this better? 
- Put T4_13 chunk back in tissue sample tube after momentarily placing in disruptor tube because it was massive ): 
- used qubit to measure dna concentrations. 2 uL sample in 198 uL working solution.
###### 7-11-24
- how frequently to replace aliquoted elution buffer?
- t4-12 sample looked like mostly skeleton
- used all tissue chunks from all samples (only sand left)
- are margin concentrations typically lower?

###### 7-12-24
- 13 samples - healthy PSTR 
- prep: aliquot elution buffer and heat, 14 samples - 42 eppendorf, 14 collection 
- forgot to tare t3-117 collection tube before adding sample. other tubes weighed 2.25, 2.2566, 2.2421 g 
	- t3-117 total: 2.3908 g - 2.25g = 140.8mg, added more: 2.4301-2.25 = 180.1mg 
- t2-82 - is this too much weight? 1 large skelelton piece that had barley any tissue on it is making it weigh more i think 

###### 7-16-24
- 3 healthy orbi (last orb)

**just realized i haven't used lo-bind tubes up until now- switching over now **

###### 7-17-24
- disease margin mcav 
	- couldn't get enough t4-14
- spilled some t1-39 while adding chtr - added 150mL more of sample 
- t4-5 used 25 uL elution buffer aliquot from 6-26 (CDE)
