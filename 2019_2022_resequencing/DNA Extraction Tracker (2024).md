##### Protocol Notes: 
###### 7-3-24
- for weighing, kept tissue samples on ice while not using, but did not keep on ice while actively pulling tissue out. handled open tubes around the flame. tried to cut pieces in tissue tube but used weigh paper underneath to catch anything. How should we be doing this? how can we standardize this better? 
- Put T4_13 chunk back in tissue sample tube after momentarily placing in disruptor tube because it was massive ): 
- used qubit to measure dna concentrations. 2 uL sample in 198 uL working solution.
###### 7-11-24
- how frequently to replace aliquoted elution buffer?
- t4-12 sample looked like mostly skeleton
- used all tissue chunks from all samples (only sand left)
- are margin concentrations typically lower?

###### 7-12-24
- 13 samples - healthy PSTR 
- prep: aliquot elution buffer and heat, 14 samples - 42 eppendorf, 14 collection 
- forgot to tare t3-117 collection tube before adding sample. other tubes weighed 2.25, 2.2566, 2.2421 g 
	- t3-117 total: 2.3908 g - 2.25g = 140.8mg, added more: 2.4301-2.25 = 180.1mg 
- t2-82 - is this too much weight? 1 large skelelton piece that had barley any tissue on it is making it weigh more i think 

###### 7-16-24
- 3 healthy orbi (last orb)

**just realized i haven't used lo-bind tubes up until now- switching over now **

###### 7-17-24
- disease margin mcav 
	- couldn't get enough t4-14
- spilled some t1-39 while adding chtr - added 150mL more of sample 
- t4-5 used 25 uL elution buffer aliquot from 6-26 (CDE)

###### 7-17-24
- diseased tissue mcav 
- t4-6 column came out of collection tube on second dna wash cycle..didn't touch anything except gloved hand (and avoided touching lower than the cap)

###### 8-9-24
- diseased past 
###### 8-12-24
- healthy mcav (19 samples - start time (incl prep): 12:40pm  - 6pm )
- 119 weighing - as high as i could get it, there wasn't even sand to add 
- t4-11 weighing - very little left in tube 
- not enough qubit tubes to measure concentrations, leaving in penguin fridge until end of the week 

###### 8-19-24 
- t1 18 & t1 21, t3 25 large chunks that I couldn't break 
- t3 11 turned yellow when xp1 buffer was added 
###### 9-11-24 
- healthy past extractions 
- for next time: make observational notes of tissue size/structure while weighing, and how much of it seems to come off during bead beating...want to see if this makes a difference in how much dna is extracted 
###### 9-13-24 
- final tissue extractions - healthy mcav and mmea
- t3 33 mmea was recorded in sample data as 32 but note said '33 sticker' was used. so tissue sample useed for extraction is '2019 t3 33 mmea'
- forgot mask for weighing first one 
- 062019_BEL_CBC_T1_3_MCAV - chunk and some beads spilled out in hood prior to adding SLX-Mlus buffer. put chunk back into tube but obviously lost some beads. surface was recently bleached  
- 185 ul working soln for neg control; put 15 uL neg control in...don't know how i ran out of working solution 
	- stds - 32.84, 18965.95
- did not save neg control because cap came off in centrifuge and qubit measured 0 ng
###### 9-16-24 
- extracting from depleted (except for 1 sample - t3 10)
- protocol: 
	- filter remaining ethanol from sample tubes through 0.22um GS nitrocellulose membrane filter (merck millipore, ref (# SA1J789H5), LOT # 0000260075)
	- filters attached to vac filter rig, all aspects of filter set up were rinsed with bleach and UVed prior to filtration.
	- scissors/forceps were flame sterilized in between samples 
	- all remaining liquid in sample tubes were filtered (~2mL each), and rinsed once more with ethanol to gather any remaining particles and put thru filtration\ 
	- filters were cut up and placed in bead tubes and the rest of [[DNA Extraction]] protocol was followed as normal 
	- bleach, di rinsed filter rig between samples 
- some of 14 spilled while adding xp1 buffer, added more xp1 buff but mightve lost some supernatant 
- could not get 400uL supernatant from MOST disruption tubes - 6, 11, and 23 were 400 for sure. 
- (threw away empty sample tubes)
- qubit standards - 32.34, 15001.97

###### 9-25-24 
- measured 8/19 & 8/12 extracted dna - 2 uL per sample 
	- may need to remeasure 150 &152
- realized i re-extracted some of these...
