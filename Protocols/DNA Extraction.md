Otherwise, follow these steps for coral DNA  extraction.

Qs for caroline
- how are we cutting up coral pieces and keeping them sterile? are we keeping tissue samples on ice while weighing out?

**Materials**
Chemicals/reagents
- [ ] P2 buffer (chilled)
- [ ] RNAse
- [ ] cHTR reagent
- [ ] Elution buffer
- [ ] XP1 buffer
- [ ] SLX-Mlus buffer
- [ ] DS buffer 
- [ ] isoproponal
- [ ] ethanol
- [ ] HBC buffer
- [ ] DNA wash buffer
Consumables
- [ ] Disruptor tubes (1 per sample??)
- [ ] 1.5 mL eppendorf tubes (3x # samples - 2 lobind, 1 regular )
- [ ] HiBind column
- [ ] collection tube


**Preparation**

-   Heat a heating block/incubator to 70 ◦C, no shaking
	- (turn high temperature heater on, turn 'high' knob to 10)
-   Aliquot elution buffer in 1.5mL eppendorf tube and place in 70C heating block
-   Make sure your P2 buffer is chilled
-   UV Sterilize 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes (3x # of samples), bag of collection tubes and hibind columns 
-  UV sterilize tweezers, scissors, 2 beakers 
-   Make sure HBC buffer and wash buffer are correctly diluted with appropriate chemicals
-   Get ice, keep tissue samples on ice while weighing 

*General aseptic technique:*
- Complete protocol in biosafety cabinet (except for weighing)
- PPE: gloves, lab coat, mask (while weighing out coral sample or handling open tubes outside of the hood)

**Tissue lysis**
*Aseptic technique for weighing out sample,*
- wear a mask 
- keep tweezers and scissors in UV-sterilized beaker
- dip tweezers and scissors in ethanol, then pass them through a flame in between each sample
- handle open tubes around the open flame if possible 

1.  Weigh approximately 150 – 250 mg of coral sample in an Eppendorf tube or directly into the disruptor tube. Weigh your sample and note down how much sample you’ve processed. 

(The disruptor tube is faster, but you cannot put the sample back if you get too much sample.)

2.  Add 725 µL of SLX-Mlus buffer to the disruptor tube. Vortex until the coral skeleton is virtually bare (usually 5-10 minutes).
    
3.  Centrifuge shortly to remove droplets from the lid.
    
4.  Add 72 µL DS buffer to each sample. Incubate at 70 degrees for 5 minutes.
    
5.  Vortex samples briefly.
    
6.  Incubate for another 5 minutes at 70 degrees.
    
7.  Add 3 µL RNAse and incubate for 2-3 minutes at 37 ˚C.
    
8.  Centrifuge at 10000 g/rpm for 5 minutes at room temperature.
    

**Inhibitor Removal**

9.  Transfer 400 µL supernatant into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. Add 135 µL chilled P2 buffer and 200 µL of resuspended cHTR reagent. (Do not shake the cHTR reagent bottle: this foams it up and barely does anything for the resuspension. Its better to just pipette up and down.) Vortex samples to mix. 
    
10.  Centrifuge at 10000 g/rpm for 1 minute at room temperature.


**Binding**

11.  Transfer supernatant to a new centrifuge tube, make sure not to disturb the pellet. Add an equal volume of XP1 buffer (about 735 µL). Vortex to mix. 
    
12.  Insert a HiBind column into a 2 mL collection tube. Transfer 700 µL of the sample into the column. Centrifuge at 10000 g/rpm for 1 minute at room temperature. Discard the filtrate and reuse the collection tube.
    
13.  Repeat step 12 until all filtrate has passed through. (should be twice)
    

**Washing**

 14. Add 500 µL of HBC buffer to the column. Centrifuge at 10000 rpm/g for 1 minute at room temperature. Discard filtrate.
 15. Transfer the HiBind® DNA Mini Column into a new 2 mL Collection Tube.
    
 16. Add 700 µL DNA wash buffer to the column. Centrifuge at 10000 rpm/g for 1 minute at room temperature. Discard filtrate.
    
 17. Repeat step 16. (DNA wash)
    
 18. Centrifuge the column without loading it with anything for 2 minutes at maximum speed at room temperature.
    

**Elution**

18.  Transfer the column to a clean empty microcentrifuge tube. Add 50 µL elution buffer, heated to 70 ˚C. Incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature. Centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 minute.
    
19.  Keep the column in the same microcentrifuge tube and add 25 µL elution buffer, heated to 70 ˚C. Incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes. Centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 minute. Discard columns.  
    
20.  Measure concentration using [[Qubit]] and store DNA at -20 ˚C. Record concentrations in lab notebook and metagenomics tracker.
