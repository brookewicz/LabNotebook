**Prepare for Assay** 
- Use qubit assay tubes
- Label tube lids not sides of tube
- UV sterilize tubes 
	- qubit assay tubes: 1x sample + 2 standards
	- larger eppendorf/sterile tube for working solution (see total mL below)
	- pipette tips 
- Prepare working solution by dilution HS Reagent 1:200 in HS Buffer

- Add 190 µL of Qubit® working solution to each of the tubes **used for standards**.
- Add 10 µL of each Qubit® standard to the appropriate tube, then mix by vortexing 2–3 seconds. Be careful not to create bubbles.
- Add Qubit® working solution to individual assay tubes so that the final volume in each tube after adding sample is 200 µL.
	- Your sample can be anywhere from 1–20 µL. Add a corresponding volume of Qubit® working solution to each assay tube: anywhere from 180–199 µL.
	- (I always do 2 uL sample, 198 uL working solution)
-  Add each sample to the assay tubes containing the correct volume of Qubit® working solution, then mix by vortexing 2–3 seconds. The final volume in each tube should be 200 µL.
- incubate tubes for at least 2 minutes before measuring in Qubit Fluorometer 
	- do not hold in hands before putting into fluorometer - warms solution and results in low readings 
	- after 2 mins, mixture is stable for 3 hours

On qubit:
- sign in on shared lab sheet 
- select "dsDNA High Sensitivity"
- reread standards before reading samples - follow prompts on 
	- will tell you if standards are bad 
	- will tell you if samples are out of range 
- remove tube from fluorometer after every reading. If you need to redo a measurement, take the tube out and equilibrate to room temp for 30s
